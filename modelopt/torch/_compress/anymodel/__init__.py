"""AnyModel: Architecture-agnostic model compression for HuggingFace models.

This module provides a declarative approach to model compression that works with
any HuggingFace model without requiring custom modeling code. Instead of duplicating
HuggingFace modeling classes, AnyModel uses ModelDescriptors that define:

1. Which decoder layer class(es) to patch for heterogeneous configs
2. How to map BlockConfig to layer-specific overrides
3. Weight name patterns for subblock checkpointing

Example usage:
    >>> from modelopt.torch._compress.anymodel import convert_model
    >>> convert_model(
    ...     input_dir="path/to/hf_checkpoint",
    ...     output_dir="path/to/anymodel_checkpoint",
    ...     converter="llama",
    ... )

Supported models:
    - llama: Llama 2, Llama 3, Llama 3.1, Llama 3.2
    - (more to come: qwen2, mistral_small, etc.)
